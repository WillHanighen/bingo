# [Modern Bingo](https://willhanighen.github.io/bingo/)

I made a modern bingo game with over 1,200 lines of code.

As for bugs, I haven't found any. Please open an issue if you find one.

I mostly made this because I saw Mr. Here (Jimmy Here) playing bingo live, and I thought I could make something better than just moving and duplicating PNGs in OBS.
