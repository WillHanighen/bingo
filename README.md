# [Modern Bingo](https://willhanighen.github.io/bingo/)

I made a modern bingo game with over 1,200 lines of code.

There are a few bugs — like the win popup showing up after every move once you complete a bingo, text not fitting inside the boxes properly, and probably other things I haven’t found yet. I might fix them at some point... or not.

I mostly made this because I saw Mr. Here (Jimmy Here) playing bingo live, and I thought I could make something better than just moving and duplicating PNGs in OBS.
