# Modern Bingo

I made a modern bingo game with over 1,200 lines of code.
their are bugs such as the win popup showing every move after completing a sucsessfull bingo and I may or may not fix them in the future, I dunno... I mostly made this because I saw Mr. Here (Jimmy Here) playing bingo on live and wanted to make something better then moving and duplicating PNGs in OBS.
